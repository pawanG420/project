Compliance Tracking: Design a database to track regulatory compliance requirements for legal entities and clients.
# Compliance Tracking Database Design

## Executive Summary
The Compliance Tracking Database is designed to effectively manage and track regulatory compliance requirements for legal entities and clients. This document outlines the structure and functionality of the MongoDB document database, ensuring compliance with legal obligations and regulatory standards.

## Project Requirements
The database must fulfill the following requirements:
- Efficiently store and manage compliance requirements for legal entities and clients.
- Enable association of compliance requirements with specific legal entities and clients.
- Facilitate easy retrieval and querying of compliance data.
- Support scalability to accommodate future growth and changes in compliance regulations.
- Ensure data integrity and security to protect sensitive compliance information.
